# MuleSoft training: DevFundamentals w/Mule-4

The contents in these folders contain solution files for walkthroughs covered each day.

What do these file types mean?

- .jar: most probably a MuleSoft app bundled as a .jar file

- .zip: most probably a RAML specification along with other associated RAML fragments

- .json or .xml: files used as sample data to build input/output schemas for DataWeave
